And finally, if you're trying to cut back on your meat consumption, broiling is a great way to enjoy the succulent flavors of grilled meats without having to fire up the grill.

#  How do you broil chicken?

There are a couple of different ways to broil chicken. You can place the chicken on the top wire rack inside the oven, or you can use a pan that is specifically designed for broiling.

In either case, preheat your oven to 500 degrees before beginning. If using a pan, place the chicken in skin-side up and let it cook for 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Then, flip it over and let it cook for an additional 3-4 minutes. If using a wire rack, place the chicken on the top wire rack and let it cook for 8-10 minutes total, flipping once halfway through.

Remember to always check the internal temperature of your chicken with a food thermometer to ensure that it has cooked all the way through (165 degrees). Serve immediately with your favorite sides!
